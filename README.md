# Satisfactory Dedicated Server Controller for Linux
A discord bot to manage your Satisfactory dedicated server from linux

Just a bot I wrote so my buddies can start, stop and reboot our dedicated server when I'm not available.
Maybe it will be useful to someone else

## Requirements
- You must be using systemctl to run your Satisfactory dedicated server in linux
- Bot must run on the same server as the satisfactory.service
- You must have python3, discord.py and dotenv
- The bot must have permissions to start, stop and reboot the server (if that's what you want)
- You'll need to create your own bot app in the discord developers portal https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
- Edit the info in the py file, tweak the service file, launch and enjoy
